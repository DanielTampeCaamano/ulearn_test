## How to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

- Clone this repository to any location of your choice.

### 2. Access the Cloned Repository

- Open a terminal in the cloned repository directory.
  - Alternatively, if you're using a GUI, navigate to the folder and open a terminal there.

### 3. Install Dependencies and Build the Project

- Run the following commands in your terminal:
  - `npm install`: Installs the required dependencies.
  - `npm run build`: Builds the project.

### 4. Run the Application

- To run the application, use the command: `composer run dev`.
- The app should now be accessible at `localhost:8000`.

### 5. Running in Production

- If you need to run the application in production, consider using Nginx or Apache.


**Note:** You will need to register when first entering the application.


## Troubleshooting "php artisan serve" Error

If you encounter the following error:
```
php artisan serve (Failed to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 (reason: ?))
```
It might be caused by a misconfigured PHP installation. You can troubleshoot it as follows:

### Steps to Fix:

1. Find the location of your `php.ini` file:
   - Run `php --ini` in the terminal and navigate to the directory.
2. Open the `php.ini` file and look for the `variables_order` directive.
3. Change its value to:
   ```ini
   variables_order = "GPCS"
   ```
4. After making the change, restart your terminal. If necessary, restart your server or your computer.

This should resolve the issue.

### Why This Works:
Laravel uses DotEnv to fetch environment variables instead of relying on PHP's environment variables. This configuration change ensures compatibility.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
